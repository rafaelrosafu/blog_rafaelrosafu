## Install:
Assuming you're running on, at least, Ruby 1.9.3, clone the repo, then:
```
bundle install
```

I recommend installing local gems and binstubs:
```
bundle install --path=_vendor --binstubs
```
Just remember to always call `bin/<comand>`, like `bin/jekyll`, `bin/rake` when using binstubs.

### Generate the static site

```
bundle exec jekyll build
```

## Acknowledgments

I would like to send a special thanks to [Cobby Chapple](http://twitter.com/cobyism), awesome designer from GitHub, that made the design for the official Jekyll site and was kind enough to [allow me to use the theme](https://twitter.com/cobyism/status/351700740068212737), thanks a bunch :)

Thanks for the Jekyll team, without it I'm not sure I would try to blog again (the third time may be the charm). Also, thanks to Dan Leech's [SimpleIcons.org], they are super useful.
